Welcome to the **Sustainable URban Futures (SURF) Lab** in the
[School of Meteorology](https://www.ou.edu/ags/meteorology) and the
[Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability](https://www.ou.edu/ags/geography)
at the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu).

Global cities in a changing climate face escalating environmental challenges, including 
intensified heat stress, more frequent air pollution episodes, shifting precipitation patterns, 
and rising demands for energy and resources.
**Dr. Chenghao Wang** and the SURF Lab investigate the mechanisms of urban environments, 
their interactions with regional and global climate systems, 
and their interconnected impacts on energy use, emissions, and planetary health. 
Using both advanced physics-based numerical models and data-driven analytical approaches, 
our work emphasizes the characterization of environmental stressors and hazards 
as well as the design and assessment of mitigation and adaptation strategies.

Through our interdisciplinary research, we aim to advance fundamental understanding of 
the complex urban systems and support the development of more sustainable and resilient 
cities under global environmental change. 
Some key research questions that motivate our work include:
- In what ways do urban environments amplify or dampen regional and global climate and weather impacts?
- What effects do urban heat mitigation strategies have on hydrometeorological conditions across scales?
- How will urban systems, including both infrastructure and people, be affected by and adapt to changing climate and weather extremes?
- What roles do inter- and intra-city interactions play in shaping the spread and influence of environmental stressors and extremes?
