Welcome to the **Sustainable URban Futures (SURF) Lab** in the
[School of Meteorology](https://www.ou.edu/ags/meteorology) and the
[Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability](https://www.ou.edu/ags/geography)
at the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu).

Global cities in a changing climate face numerous environmental challenges, such as
exacerbated heat stress, frequent air-pollution episodes, degraded water quality, and
increased energy and water use. **Dr. Chenghao Wang** and his SURF Lab study the
mechanisms of urban environments, their interactions with regional and global climates,
and their impacts on building energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and public health
using numerical models and data analytics. Through our interdisciplinary research, we
aim to advance understanding of the urban environment and support more sustainable urban
development under global environmental changes.
