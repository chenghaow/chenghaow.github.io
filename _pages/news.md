      <strong>[Job Ad]</strong> We invite applications for two fully funded full-time Postdoctoral Researcher positions focused on the modeling of air quality and/or greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the urban environment. Areas of focus include but are not limited to: (1) Development of new or improved numerical parameterization schemes, (2) Spatial and temporal characterization of air pollution (e.g., ozone and particulate matter) and GHGs, and (3) Assessment of mitigation strategies to reduce air pollutants and GHG emissions. Both positions are based in Norman, OK, and will be working with <strong>Dr. Chenghao Wang</strong> and <strong>Dr. Xiao-Ming Hu</strong>. <strong>Qualifications:</strong> Applicants must have earned a Ph.D. in Atmospheric Sciences, Engineering, Earth Science, Computer Science, or a closely related field by the time of appointment. Candidates should have demonstrated experience with numerical 3D air quality models, such as WRF-Chem, CMAQ, HYSPLIT, GEOS-Chem, and LES models, be proficient in programming languages commonly used in models (Fortran) and data analytics (MATLAB, Python, R, or NCL), and possess strong oral and written communication skills, evidenced by their publication record and presentations at scientific meetings. Applicants are encouraged to apply as soon as possible. Please submit your application through <a href="http://apply.interfolio.com/150611" target="_blank">http://apply.interfolio.com/150611</a> by <strong>Sep 30, 2024</strong>.
