        Chase was a senior undergraduate student at OU, 
        majoring in Meteorology. Although he has always been interested in tornadoes, 
        he only really started to wonder how urban environments affect them after the March 2/3rd 2020 Nashville tornado. 
        He worked with Emily Barbini on a Capstone project on how urban areas can impact supercell thunderstorms, with guidance from Dr. Wang.

      <p>     
        Outside of weather, he enjoys Dungeons and Dragons, video games, and lacrosse. 
        He hopes to continue researching tornadoes and supercells for years to come.

        Emily was a senior undergraduate student at OU, majoring in Meteorology. 
        She is from Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. Her interests include urban environments and severe weather events, 
        as well as GIS. In her Capstone class, she has teamed up with Chase Green to research how urban areas can impact supercell thunderstorms, with guidance from Dr. Wang. 
        Emily also worked on a second research project under the sponsorship of the NWS West Gulf River Forecast Center (WGRFC), 
        where she analyzed how the urban environment of Dallas-Fort Worth can impact flooding conditions in its surrounding region. 
        For her, these two projects were the first exposures to real-world research.
      </p>

        In the summer of 2022, Emily participated with researchers in a TORUS field campaign. 
        One year later, she also aided researchers in the OUTFLOW field campaign. However, 
        her time with OUTFLOW was cut short as she returned home to intern for the NWS West Gulf River Forecast 
        Center via the NOAA Pathways program. There, she helped in the development of the recently released 
        NWS Categorical Flood Inundation Maps. Outside of the realm of meteorology, Emily 
        enjoys activities such as playing soccer, traveling, and amateur nature photography. 
        Among her favorite subjects to photograph include the flora and fauna that she comes across.

        Jonathan was a senior at OU and graduated with a B.S. in Geographic Information Science and a minor in Meteorology. 
        Jonathan has been passionate about weather and the physical sciences for as long as he can remember, 
        with a particular interest in severe weather. He worked on a Capstone Project, “NEXRAD radar network optimization using a GIS-based approach”, with Dr. Wang.

        Outside of academics, he spends a lot of time playing games and being involved in/watching esports, 
        he both produces his own and enjoys listening to electronic music, and he is an avid baseball fan. 
        He also enjoys spending time hiking, playing tennis, and doing cosplay.

        Sarah Henry was an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois studying aerospace engineering and atmospheric sciences. 
        Her interests lie broadly in the areas of climatology and atmospheric dynamics. 
        Her work in the past has involved working with climate model output data to evaluate the effects of 
        greenhouse gases and aerosols on tropical cyclone genesis. 
        She was a member of the 2023 National Weather Center Research Experience for Undergraduates cohort and 
        was mentored by Dr. Wang. Her work during the REU program focused on understanding how the frequency of compound 
        air pollution and heat wave events in urban areas has changed due to global warming.
